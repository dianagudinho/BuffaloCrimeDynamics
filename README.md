# BuffaloCrimeDynamics

Technologies: Pandas, Sodapy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

API Integration: Socrata Open Data API

Project Overview: Crime remains a significant issue affecting public safety, quality of life, and community cohesion in cities. This project aims to leverage historical crime data from Buffalo's public safety database to build a predictive model that forecasts future crime incidents in various neighborhoods.


✔ Data Acquisition & Preparation: Developed a real-time data acquisition system using Python and the Socrata Open Data API, which ensured continuous updates and accurate analysis of crime data.
✔ Model Development: Applied Logistic Regression and Random Forest models on over 300k crime records.
✔ Feature Engineering: Identified key predictors from the data, including temporal and geographic crime patterns.

Challenges & Solutions:
✔ Challenge: Handling incomplete or inconsistent crime records from the city database.
✔ Solution: Developed preprocessing techniques to clean the data, ensuring high data quality. The real-time data acquisition system kept the model updated with current crime data for more accurate predictions.


Key Achievements / Outcomes:
✔ Real-time data integration: Built a reliable, real-time data system that allowed for continuous model updates, ensuring adaptability to evolving crime patterns.
✔ Accuracy: Achieved a model accuracy of 94.66%, delivering reliable forecasts for law enforcement's operational strategies.
✔ Strategic Impact: This project provided a proactive tool to anticipate crime, allocate resources more effectively, and reduce response times in high-risk areas.
